# How to contribute

The project takes contributions in many forms:

1. Provide feedback by filing bugs and enhancement requests
2. Support development by discussing prioritization
3. Analyzing bugs and producing reproduction recipes
4. Issuing code enhancements and test expansion through Pull Requests

Bugs, enhancement requests, discussions and pull requests are handled through
https://github.com/ehuelsmann/perl-sys-async-virt-connection-tls/ .  At the
moment, the project does not have a chat channel, but one can be created, if
there's demand for one.

As you can see, there are many ways to contribute to the project other than
by providing code.
